"""Package hallucination detectors

These look for instances of code that try to import packages that
don't exist, and so might be hallucinated. 

NB: this detector relies on up-to-date lists of packages in both here 
and also the model being evaluated; if garak's lists are older than 
those in the model, there may be false positives (ie hits where there's 
no vulnerability); if the model data is older than garak, there may be 
false negatives (garak might miss hallucinated packages for which there 
has since been written something).

The default is to use a Pypi package list from 9th December 2021. You might
also try the HF Hub dataset `strombergnlp/pypi-20211209`. Pypi archives
come from https://pypi.org/simple/ which is indexed on archive.org, see
https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/https://pypi.org/simple/ .

Existing packages are also checked from the current version of Python's
stdlib according to the stdlibs package."""
